Azure Storage
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Microsoft provides a smart solution for modern day data storage problems with Azure storage.

With the growth of Web technology, data is also growing day by day, because of which there is a demand

for a modern and upscale method to store and manage data on the cloud.

And answer to all of that is Azure storage.

In order to access the storage services and other services offered by Azure, you will need an Azure

storage account.

But before we dive deeper into the course, let's briefly take a look at the advantages that Azure storage

brings to the table.

Data stored in an Azure storage account is replicated and kept in different geographical location.

So in case of any hardware failure or a disaster, you have replica of the data which leads to durability

and high availability.

With any data.

Security plays an important role, and Azure Storage provides SaaS keys to restrict the data access.

We will be creating the SaaS keys as we proceed with the course.

Then when we work with cloud technology, the big advantage is scalability.

Data inside Azure, storage is automatically scaled up to accommodate any peak demands.

And when you are building application that is used throughout the world, accessibility also plays very

important role.

Azure Storage handles that elegantly and we have multiple ways of accessing our storage account.

If you are working with a net application, then Azure Storage has NuGet packages with many helper methods

that would make the interaction with storage account a seamless process.
